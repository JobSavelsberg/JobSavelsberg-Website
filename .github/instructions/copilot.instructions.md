## Project

This is a personal website for Job Savelsberg, showcasing his work and providing information about his projects. It should be minimal, but visually appealing, with a focus on content and usability, but also allows for creativity.

## Tech Stack

-   Astro v5
-   TypeScript for logic

## Coding Style

-   Use `.astro` components for pages and layouts
-   Keep UI components small and reusable
-   Use CSS where possible, instead of querying the DOM for styles
-   Use classes for styling, avoid inline styles
-   Make code simple and readable, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
-   Code should be self-explanatory, don't state the obvious in comments, use them to clarify assumptions, or denote regions
-   Don't future-proof too much, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
-   Minimize the amount of state that needs to be managed

## Tools

-   Use fetch to retrieve information about Astro's best practices and features. (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/)
-   Use fetch multiple times if necessary.
