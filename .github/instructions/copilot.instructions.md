## Project

This is a personal website for Job Savelsberg, showcasing his work and providing information about his projects. It should be minimal, but visually appealing, with a focus on content and usability, but also allows for creativity.

## Tech Stack

- Astro v5
- Svelte for logic-containing components
- TypeScript for pure logic
- Tailwind v4.1 CSS for styling

## Coding Style

- Use `.astro` components for pages and layouts that don't require logic
- Use `.svelte` components for interactive UI elements
- Use TypeScript for pure logic and type safety
- Keep UI components small and reusable
- Make code simple and readable, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Code should be self-explanatory, don't state the obvious in comments, use them to clarify assumptions, or denote regions
- Don't future-proof too much, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- Minimize the amount of state that needs to be managed

## Tools

- Use fetch to retrieve information about Astro's best practices and features. (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/)
- Use fetch multiple times if necessary.
